## Project Overview
This project is an implementation in C to support epidemic prevention and control in universities during the COV pandemic. The primary goal is to create a comprehensive and efficient system for managing and storing crucial information related to COV prevention and control within the university setting. The system can handle diverse data types, including personal student details, daily health reports, nucleic acid testing results, vaccination records, and leave applications.

## Features
1. **Management of Personal Student Information**: Stores and manages comprehensive details of students, including IDs, names, phone numbers, and email addresses.
2. **Daily Health Report Tracking**: Monitors and records students' daily health conditions, including temperature and symptoms.
3. **Nucleic Acid Test Result Management**: Manages and records the outcomes of nucleic acid tests.
4. **Vaccination Record Maintenance**: Keeps detailed logs of students' vaccination data.
5. **Leave Application Handling**: Processes and documents students' leave requests.
6. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Provides graphical statistical analysis for the maintained data.
